# Comp Sci 2022 Project
 The end of year project for comp sci 2022 at Merivale

## Languages

The back-end was programmed in JavaScript using Node.js. The front-end was scripted using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The data base used was Mongodb all together comprising MEAN / MERN stack without using Angular or React due to the simplicity of the project.

## Utility

The **project** enables signing in and out while storing user information, such as classes & student in these class. This involved building and planning a data structure to follow. I also created a page flow layout that checked certain factors before allowing changes to student grades and placing to be commited. The website allows for fluid management of students which can be changed.
